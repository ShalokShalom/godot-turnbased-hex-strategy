### Unit list
# Contains definitions for all units in the game.
# Will be parsed in-game and refined as the development goes on.

# Some attributes explained:
# unit_sprites (path to one image file)
# This contains one or more sprites that are shown in game to represent
# the unit on the map. If more than one sprite is found, the one shown is selected randomly.
# Sprites can also be selected manually in the editor.
# If a sprite should not be included in the random selection but should still be selectable
# in the editor (story related, special camo etc.) you must prefix the images filename with
# the `!`-character.
# --
# base_defense (int)
# This is factored into calculating the damage done by attacks.
# --
# armor (int)
# This is factored into calculating the damage done by various weapon types.
# armor_piercing weapons are more effective against this unit if the value is greater than zero.
# explosive weapons are more effective against this unit if the value is smaller or equal to zero.
# --
# movement_points (int)
# The number of tiles with movement_cost = 1 this unit can cross in one turn. If the terrain
# is rugged and has higher movement_cost, the number of tiles is reduced accordingly.
# --
# fuel (int)
# The amount of movement_points a unit has in general before it needs refueling.
# This value can be -1 if the unit consumes no fuel.
# --
# main_ammo (int)
# How many times can this unit attack until ammo runs out, not really how many shots it carries.
# --
# attack_bonus (int)
# This can be thought of as a "base_attack" value of the unit. It is simply added to the 
# main_weapon attack_strength value. It could be used to signify better training of this 
# unit or technical characteristics that would give it a significant attack boost compared 
# to another unit with the same main_weapon.
# This will be mostly used via modifiers.

# Note that the top level ID is not used and just used as a container.
# You can name it as you like. The ID used in the game is actually `unit_id`
